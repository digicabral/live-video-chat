# live-video-chat

This repository was created with the goal of understanding and practicing the functioning of WebRTC and socket.io.

To achieve this, I created a video chat application where the front end connects to the server, and the server connects to the other end of the conversation.

The front end uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The back end uses TypeScript.
